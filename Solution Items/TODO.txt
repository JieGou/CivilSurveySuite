//========================= NOTES ==========================
When you apply the CommandMethod attribute to a non-static method, AutoCAD's
managed runtime will create multiple instances of your class, one for each
document that you invoke the command in. Those instances are not created until
you invoke the command.

The problem you have is that AutoCAD's managed runtime also creates an instance
of the class with the IExtensionApplication attribute on it as well, so multiple
instances of your class are getting created, which obviously wasn't your
intention.

For one thing, it's not wise to implement commands in the same class that
implements IExtensionApplication, but if you really wanted to do that, you could
if you make the command handler methods static. If you're not sure about the
difference between static and non-static (or 'instance') methods, get a hold of
some basic C# learning materials, and try to become more familar with the basic
concepts that underly the tools you're working with.

point report /w alingments
Generates detailed point reports with user controlled columns.  Includes Lat/Lon and alignment station/offset fields. 
Save entire report as HTML or data tabel only to CSV, DBF, XML, etc.  Also include extended point data columns (Civil3D UDP)!



---Create point at extension distance on grade between 2 points.

---Quickly add/remove points by description match, elevation range, inside linear object or window, number range, etc.





Label Mask on/off for labels







The SPPointElevationsFromSurfaces command allows the user to show point tables with the elevations from 2 surfaces, in addition to the point elevation.
After starting the SPPointElevationsFromSurfaces command, you will be presented with a form from which you select the points, or PointGroups, to compare, 
select the 2 surfaces to use, and the 2 UserDefinedProperties (these must be pre-defined as elevation types).
Once the selection is complete the selected points will have the respective UDP's assigned the surface elevations. You can now assign a label style to 
the points which displays those UDP's, use the DisplayPoints Sincpac tool to create a report, or export the points out to a text file. If you need to 
also include station/offset information, use the DL_Points tool to link the points to alignment(s).

The SPSetMidPointsBetweenPolys command will allow the user to select two polylines then pick random locations on screen where they would like to get 
the midpoint between the 2 polylines. This can be useful for using the BestFit Alignment tool in Civil 3D when the surveyor only provided edge of pavement 
shots. At the command prompt for selecting the polylines you may enter T to bring up the Settings dialog.

The RemoveBreaklineFromSurface command allows the user to remove selected objects from the Surface definition to which it is connected. This command is
only available in Sincpac C3D version 3 and newer.
After starting the RemoveBreaklineFromSurface command, you will be prompted to select breaklines. You may select objects that are not breaklines, they will 
be ignored during processing. Should a breakline be encountered which is used in more than one surface, you will be prompted to choose which surface(s) 
you want it to be removed from. The surface will be rebuilt upon completion of the command.

The SelectPointsAboveOrBelowSurface command allows the user to create a selection of points lying either Above or Below a chosen Surface.
Usage
Type SelectPointsAboveOrBelowSurface at the command line. You will be presented with a form to choose which Surface to use, which method - Above or Below - 
to use, and to optionally limit the selection to points in one or more Point Groups. Make the desired selections, press OK, and the corresponding Points 
will become selected. You can choose to have your selections saved for the next use of this command.
As command line alternatives, there are the 2 commands SelectPointsAboveSurface and SelectPointsBelowSurface which will operate on all points and just 
present you with a small form with which to choose the Surface.
Note that you may not see the selection on screen as gripped objects, as the number of gripped objects is limited by the AutoCAD Sysvar GRIPOBJLIMIT.
