point report /w alingments
Generates detailed point reports with user controlled columns.  Includes Lat/Lon and alignment station/offset fields. 
Save entire report as HTML or data tabel only to CSV, DBF, XML, etc.  Also include extended point data columns (Civil3D UDP)!

---Add multiple points (with interpolated elevation) between two points.
---Add multiple points that are offsets of a line defined by two points.
---Add a point at a picked location with elevation calculated at designated slope.
---Create point at extension distance on grade between 2 points.

---Quickly add/remove points by description match, elevation range, inside linear object or window, number range, etc.

---Intersection of Bearing-Bearing, Bearing-Distance, Distance-Distance, 4 Points.

---Inverses between points (pick or number), echoes coordinates, azimuths, bearings, horz/vert distance and slope.

Label Mask on/off for labels

---The CreatePointsFromLabels command can be used to create Civil-3D Points at the exact location and elevation of Surface Elevation Labels found in a drawing.

---The UsedPt command displays a list of used point numbers in the command window.
---Usage
---Type UsedPt at the command line. The available point numbers in the drawing are displayed in the command window, as in the following example:

---The SPPointElevationsFromSurfaces command allows the user to show point tables with the elevations from 2 surfaces, in addition to the point elevation.
---After starting the SPPointElevationsFromSurfaces command, you will be presented with a form from which you select the points, or PointGroups, to compare, 
---select the 2 surfaces to use, and the 2 UserDefinedProperties (these must be pre-defined as elevation types).
---Once the selection is complete the selected points will have the respective UDP's assigned the surface elevations. You can now assign a label style to 
---the points which displays those UDP's, use the DisplayPoints Sincpac tool to create a report, or export the points out to a text file. If you need to 
---also include station/offset information, use the DL_Points tool to link the points to alignment(s).

---The SPSetMidPointsBetweenPolys command will allow the user to select two polylines then pick random locations on screen where they would like to get 
the midpoint between the 2 polylines. This can be useful for using the BestFit Alignment tool in Civil 3D when the surveyor only provided edge of pavement 
shots. At the command prompt for selecting the polylines you may enter T to bring up the Settings dialog.

---The ZoomPt command zooms the display to the specified point number.
---Usage
---Type ZoomPt at the command line. You will be prompted to enter either the Number or Name of the Cogo Point to zoom to.
---You may also hit ENTER without typing anything to enter a new height factor. The zoom height is determined by taking the current Annotation Scale and 
---multiplying it by this number. Enter a lower number for the zoom height factor to zoom in closer to the point, or a higher number to zoom out further. 
---The default zoom height factor is 4.

---The RemoveBreaklineFromSurface command allows the user to remove selected objects from the Surface definition to which it is connected. This command is
---only available in Sincpac C3D version 3 and newer.
---After starting the RemoveBreaklineFromSurface command, you will be prompted to select breaklines. You may select objects that are not breaklines, they will 
---be ignored during processing. Should a breakline be encountered which is used in more than one surface, you will be prompted to choose which surface(s) 
---you want it to be removed from. The surface will be rebuilt upon completion of the command.

---The SelectPointsAboveOrBelowSurface command allows the user to create a selection of points lying either Above or Below a chosen Surface.
---Usage
---Type SelectPointsAboveOrBelowSurface at the command line. You will be presented with a form to choose which Surface to use, which method - Above or Below - 
---to use, and to optionally limit the selection to points in one or more Point Groups. Make the desired selections, press OK, and the corresponding Points 
---will become selected. You can choose to have your selections saved for the next use of this command.
---As command line alternatives, there are the 2 commands SelectPointsAboveSurface and SelectPointsBelowSurface which will operate on all points and just 
---present you with a small form with which to choose the Surface.
---Note that you may not see the selection on screen as gripped objects, as the number of gripped objects is limited by the AutoCAD Sysvar GRIPOBJLIMIT.
